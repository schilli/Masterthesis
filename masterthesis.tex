\begin{abstract}

A fusion protein of the periplasmic domain of sensor histidine kinase CitA from \textit{Klebsiella Pneumoniae} and the lipase LipA from \textit{Bacillus Subtilis} is investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulation.
The research was motivated by experiments indicating that CitA's natural ligand citrate down-regulates lipase activity upon binding.
Both proteins have first been studied independently.
It was found that the citrate binding pocket was stable in the citrate bound crystal structure when studied in a 100ns molecular dynamics simulation after carefull equilibration.
The unfused lipase was also very stable during a simulation of the same length, especially the binding pocket and the catalytic residues maintained their conformations.
As no crystal structure of the fusion protein is known, several possible structures have been generated \emph{in silico} by basin hopping.
The fusion protein showed dynamics that differ significantly from those of the isolated proteins.
The presence of citrate in the receptor binding pocket did not stabilize the structure to the same extend compared to the isolated CitA.
The presence of a covalently bound citrate binding domain to the lipase destabilized the LipA binding pocket significantly.
This is most likely the reason for the experimentally found activity degradation in lipase activity.

\section{Introduction}

The structure and kinetics of two proteins under investigation are well known:
The periplasmic domain of sensor \textit{Klebsiella pneumoniae} histidine kinase CitA (CitAP, PDB accession code \PDB{2J80}) \cite{CitA_2J80}
and the lipase LipA of \textit{Bacillus subtilis} (BSLA, PDB accession code \PDB{1I6W}), \cite{BSLA_1I6W} both in their ligand bound and ligand free states.
CitAP is a periplasmic citrate receptor that, upon activation by citrate binding, triggers a cytoplasmic reaction cascade starting with the autophosphorylation of the endoplasmic domain of CitA and finally leading to the transcription of citrate fermentation genes.
%BSLA's efficient lipid hydrolysis capability is industrially utilized for many applications, including its use as an additive in laundry detergents.
What is not understood is the structure and kinetics of a fusion protein of these two peptides.
It was speculated if citrate binding could influcence lipase activity, thus creating a switchable detergent.
Experiments indicate that citrate binding to the sensor kinase domain indeed down-regulates lipase activity (Figure \ref{fig:BSLAactivity}).
This effect is of major interest to the chemical industry as lipases exhibit a wide diversity in substrate specificity and have found applications in the resolution of racemic mixtures, the synthesis of esters, transesterification reactions and as additives in laundry detergents.
As chemical applications would benefit from the opposite effect, a controlled up-regulation of lipase activity triggered by citrate addition, this research focused on the structure elucidation of the fused protein, as well as on the mechanism by which lipase activity is regulated.
A thorough understanding of this mechanism might in the future enable us to engineer the protein to invert the regulatory effect of citrate binding.
The main methods used for structure elucidation are global optimization using the Monte Carlo-minimization approach basin hopping, followed by high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations.

\section{Proteins Under Investigation}

% ==================================== %

\subsection{\textit{Bacillus Subtilis} Lipase LipA}

\textit{Bacillus Subtilis} is a gram-positive, aerobic bacterium found in soil and water, that is subject to active research since 1992 \cite{bacillusSubtilis}.
\textit{Bacillus Subtilis} is of major industrial interest because of its highly efficient protein secretion system \cite{BSsecretion} enabling the production of proteases and amylases in bulk quantities \cite{BSworkhorse}.
Of special interest are its excreted lipases, as these catalyze the hydrolysis and synthesis of long chain triacylglycerols \cite{BSLA_1I6W}.
These lipases possess a wide substrate specificity.
They find applications in transesterification reactions, the synthesis of esthers, the resolution of racemic mixtures and are used as additives in laundry detergents \cite{BSdetergents}.

The reported experiments where performed using lipase LipA from \textit{Bacillus Subtilis} (BSLA).
Compared to lipases from other organisms BSLA is relatively small, consisting of 181 amino acids and weighting slightly more than 19 kDA.
BSLA belongs to the $\alpha$-$\beta$ hydrolase fold enzymes.
Members of this protein family are constituted by a twisted $\beta$-strand core flanked by alpha helices on both sides \cite{alphaBetaHydrolases}.
Because of its small size and because other known $\alpha$-$\beta$ hydrolase fold enzymes extend on this core structure, it can be considered a minimal $\alpha$-$\beta$ hydrolase.
BSLA hydrolyses sn-1 and sn-3 glycerol esthers with long fatty acid chains, while its highest activity is exhibited on medium sized fatty acids \cite{BSLA_1I6W}.
The optimum environment is reported to be found at pH 10 \cite{BSLA_1I6W}.

Most known lipases possess an $\alpha$-helical segment that covers the active site.
The encounter of lipid-aggregates triggers the opening of this lid, exposing the active site and triggering catalytic activity.
This behaviour is known as interfacial activation \cite{alphaBetaHydrolases}.
BSLA lacks this lid, resulting in an active site that is solvent exposed and thus activlely hydrolising fatty acids even in the absence of lipid-aggregates.

The active site is located at the bottom of a shallow cleft formed by four turns (Figure \ref{fig:BSLAactiveSite}).
Its structure is in accordance with the secondary structure topology of the canonical $\alpha$/$\beta$-hydrolase fold, in which the acitve site is formed by a nucleophile, an acid and a histidine, together called the catalytic triad \cite{BSLA_1I6W}.
In BSLA this catalytic triad is constituted of Ser77 (nucleophile), Asp133 (acid) and His156.
Serine 77 is located at the so called nucleophilic elbow \cite{nucleophileElbow}, a sharp turn at the bottom of the binding pocket connecting a central $beta$-sheet to a peripheral $\alpha$-helix.
The ester hydrolysis catalyzed by BSLA is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:BSLAreaction}.
The ligand binds covalently with its phosphoryl group to Ser77.
A tetrahedral intermediate structure is formed.
One phosphoryl oxygen of the substrate is hydrogen bound to the \ce{NH} atoms of Met78 and Ile12, forming the oxyanion hole that is common to most lipases \cite{BSLA_1I6W}.
The \ce{N^{$\epsilon$}} atom of His156 is located at hydrogen bonding distance from the Ser77 \ce{O^{$\gamma$}} atom and the substrate esther oxygen.

\subsection{Periplasmic Domain of Sensor Histidine Kinase CitA}

CitA is the sensor histidine kinase of a two component regulatory system of \textit{Klebsiella Pneumoniae} \cite{CitA_original}.
These systems generaly consist of a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator (CitB in the present case).
Sensor histidine kinases respond to environmental conditions by autophosphorilation of a conserved histidine residue.
The phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred to a conserved Aspartate residue on the response regulator.
The phosphorylated response regulator in turn triggers a change in gene expression or cell behaviour \cite{CitA_original}.
The CitA/CitB regulatory system controls the expression of citrate frementation genes.
Citrate metabolims requires careful regulation, as an uncontrolled upregulation in the absence of citrate would break the citric acid cycle with servere consequences for the organism \cite{CitA_original}.

Like most known sensor histidine kinases, CitA is a membrane protein, the domain composition of which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:CitA_organization}.
Its extracellular N-terminal sensor domain is flanked by two transmembrane helices, one of which links to the intracellular autokinase domain.
Like virtually all known sensor histidine kinases, CitA appears to be dimeric \cite{2CST}.
In many cases only the structures of extracellular domains of sensor kinases are known, due to the inherent difficulties of obtaining structural information about membrane proteins.
This is also true for CitA, where only structures of the periplasmic domain (CitAP) have been resolved.
The overall fold of the periplasmic domain of sensor histidine kinases classifies them as members of the Per-Arnt-Sim domain superfamily.
This superfamily comprises many well studied sensor histidine kinases \cite{PAS}.


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/CitA_organization.png}
    \caption{CitA domain organization. Only the structure of the periplasmic domain (CitAP) is known and was used in the reported research. Histidine 350 gets phosphorylated after signal transduction as described in the text. Figure taken from \cite{CitA_original}}
    \label{fig:CitA_organization}
\end{figure}   


The mechanism of action of CitA \cite{CitA_original} is initiated by citrate binding, triggering a conformational change of the periplasmic domain that is mediated by a transmembrane helix to the cytoplasmic kinase domain.
It has been hypothesized that this mediation happens by a piston-like mechanism (see Figure \ref{fig:CitA_mechanism}) in which transmembrane helix 2 is pulled out of the membrane.
The resulting conformational change in the kinase domain allows the interaction of the ATP-binding subdomain with the cytoplasmic phosphorylation subdomain.
After autophosphorylation the subdomains dissociate.
The phosphorylation subdomain can now bind to the receiver domain of the response regulator CitB.
A final phosphotransfer on the phosphorylation domain from histidine to an aspartate completes the CitA cycle and new response can be triggered.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/CitA_mechanism.png}
    \caption{Hypothetical mode of action of CitA. The citrate triggered conformational change of the periplasmic domain is mediated to the cytoplasmic kinase domain by a piston-like mechanism. Figure taken from \cite{CitA_2J80}}
    \label{fig:CitA_mechanism}
\end{figure}    



The binding pocket of CitAP build up from the $\beta$-sheet core that forms the bottom and two loops, the minor loop (residue 96 to 106) and the major loop (residue 63 to 92).
These loops form tight lids covering the bound ligand and forming a closed pocket.
While the \textit{in vivo} conformation of the termini remains uncertain due to crystal packing artifacts the core structure of the bound CitAP has been solved with 1.6 $\mathring{A}$ resolution and has been experimentally found to be well folded in solution \cite{CitA_2J80}.
The major loop is unresolved in the unbound CitAP structures, indicating that it is highly mobile without the stabilizing effect of the ligand.
The core structure of the protein is highly similar for the bound and unbound structures with similar backbone positions and sidechain orientations of the binding residues not located in the loops \cite{CitA_2J80}.
A sodium ion has been crystalized in the citrate bound structures.
Its physiological significance had already been indicated by the fact that sodium is required for the induction of the CitA/CitB target genes \cite{KlebsiellaMetabolism} and is backed by the by the fact that no sodium has been found in the citrate free crystal structure.

It has been reported that citrate binding to CitAP is highly specific and that virtually all CitAP is in the bound state under physiological citrate concentrations \cite{CitA_2J80}.
Citrate interacts mainly with Thr58, Arg66, His69, Glu80, Ser101, Leu102, Arg107, Lys109 and Ser124 by hydrogen bonding (Figure \ref{fig:citrate_interactions}).
A further hydrogen bond is mediated by a water molecule to Gly103.
The conformational change in the periplasmic domain of sensor histidine kinase CitA is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:CitA_opening}.
The main conformational change is a flattening of the $\beta$-sheet that forms the minor loop.
Upon citrate binding this $\beta$-sheet is pulled in due to interaction with the ligand.
This disrupts some of the interactions with neighbouring $\beta$-sheets and subsequently pulls the C-terminus away from the membrane.
The unstructured major loop in the citrate free crystal structure indicates that the citrate binding pocket is less stable when citrate is not present.

\end{figure}      


% ==================================== %

\subsection{Fusion Complex}

The two proteins described earlier have been fused in the laboratory, motivated by the desire to regulate the lipolytic activity of BSLA.
A controlled upregulation by a cheap and non-toxic molecule such as citrate could be utilized to switch on the desired katalysis at specified times.
It was assumed that the conformational change of CitAP triggered by citrate binding could have a regulatory effect on lipase activity.
Experiments have been performed by Jaeger et al. to test this hypothesis (Figure \ref{fig:BSLAactivity}).

The sequence of the fused construct as used in the experiments performed in the group of Karl-Erich Jaeger is shown in Figure \ref{fig:complex_sequence}.
CitAP was connected to BSLA by means of a linker helix that was taken from YtvA, the blue light sensor of \textit{Bacillus Subtilis} (PDB accession code: \PDB{2PR5}).
A polyhistidine-tag (His-tag) was attached to allow easy purification and
an Xa protease site was included in the complexed protein as it was found experimentally that this increased the effect of citrate on BSLA activity.

Although it was attempted to up-regulate the lipase activity by citrate binding, experiments indicated the opposite effect (Figure \ref{fig:BSLAactivity}).
While increasing citrate concentrations had no effect on uncomplexed BSLA activity, lipolysis was significantly reduced at higher citrate concentrations in the CitAP-BSLA complex protein to about 40\% of the initial activity of the complex.
Jaeger et al. determined by sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation, that the fusion protein exists mainly as a monomer with globular shape (results not published).

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Molecular Dynamics}

The main method that was used in the presented research is Molecular Dynamics simulations (MD) based on classical Molecular Mechanics (MM) \cite{MDintro}.
In Molecular Mechanics molecules are modelled as systems of chemically inert atoms that interact through Newtonian mechanics.
The interaction energy between atoms is described by preferably simple mathematical equations, mainly harmonic and trigonometric functions, as well as the well known electrostatic and Lennard-Jones potentials.
A given set of potential energy formulas, together with its parameters, is called a force field, as it is used to compute the interatomic forces (see also section \ref{sec:forcefields}).
These forces are then numerically integrated to obtain a trajectory in phase-space.
This trajectory can in turn be used to estimate thermodynamic quantities (e.g. free energies), as well as to derive dynamic properties, such as normal modes of protein movement \cite{normalModes}.
Molecuar Dynamics has been successfully used to study biomolecules for more than 35 years \cite{MDbiomolecules}.


To analyze the obtained data a large variety of methods exist ranging from hydrogen bond network and interaction energy analysis to principal component and normal mode analysis, to name just a few.
 
% ==================================== %
 
\subsubsection{Force Fields}
\label{sec:forcefields}

A great variety of force fields exists and a careful and well informed choice about the set of equations and parameters that can model the system under investigation best has to be made.
Recent benchmarks of protein force fields give insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the available options \cite{proteinFF}, indicating that one of the most up to date corrections to the widely used amber force field \cite{amber99sb-ildn-nmr} is the best choice for simulations of proteins.

\subsection{Basin Hopping with GMIN}

Global minima of energy landscapes in the conformational space of macromolecules are hard to determine due to the large dimensionality and the overwhelming number of possible conformations.
A clever approach to nevertheless takle this problem has been invented by David Wales et al.
Their basin hopping algorithm attempts to find the global minimum of the energy landscape by generating conformations randomly, that are subsequently minimized in energy to get to the bottom of a local energy minimum \cite{basinHopping}, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:GMIN}.

At each step the basin hopping algorithm minimizes the given structure to find the closest local energy minimum, the energy basin.
This can for example be done by a gaussian minimization or a conjugate gradient approach.
Subsequently a new conformation is generated by a Monte Carlo procedure. 
In general, molecular Monte Carlo simulations randomly generate new conformations by translating or rotating atoms or groups of atoms.
The generated conformation is then accepted with a probability that decreases exponentially with the energy difference between the new and old conformations.
Plain Monte Carlo simulations theoretically sample the complete energy landscape, but unforutnately this is a very slow process.
Basin hopping provides a much faster alternative if one is only interested in local energy minima instead of the detailed structure of the energy surface.
This is the case if the structure of interes is the global minimum of a system or if the goal is to find out about relative differences between energy minima.
The newly generated structure has a significant chance of being located distantly enough from the previous structure on the energy landscape, such that a new energy minimization finds a distinct energy basin.

In repeating these steps, the landscape of local energy minima can be sampled as depicted by the rectangular energy surface in Figure \ref{fig:GMIN}.
If the energy minima are the property of interest this reveals all interesting information contained in the full energy surface (curved line in Figure \ref{fig:GMIN}) at a much smaller computational cost.

The basin hopping algorithm is implemented in the program GMIN \cite{GMIN}.

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/GMIN.pdf}

\subsection{Dimensionality Reduction}

The data obtained in molecular simulations is high dimensional as every atom position is specified by 3 coordinates (ignoring velocities and forces).
Often the important features of a system can be described by a reduced set of coordinates to make the analysis less complicated.
Knowledge of the system can guide the definition of these reduced, or collective coordinates, but techniques exist to automatically reduce the dimensionality wihtout prior assumptions.
Techniques of both kinds have been used in the reported research and are described here as applied to the fused CitAP--BSLA complex.

A well established technique used for dimensionality reduction in all kinds of applications is Principal Component Analysis (PCA) \cite{PCAoriginal} \cite{PCA}.
PCA is an orthogonal linear transform that transforms the dataset into a space whose basis is spanned by the principal component vectors.
The key feature of PCA is that the dataset has its largest variance (i.e. highest information content) along the first principal component vector and the variances decrease along the following principal components.
This ordering allows the removal of principal components from the dataset with low variance, therefore reducing its complexity but at the same time maintainting the maximal information content for the reduced dataset.

Mathematically, PCA works as follows.
Let the matrix $\vect{X}$ represent a dataset whose row vectors represent datapoints with zero empirical mean.
The covariance matrix of this dataset is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \vect{\Sigma} = \vect{X}^{T} \vect{X},
\end{equation}
where the superscript $T$ denotes the transpose of $\vect{X}$.
The covariance is then diagonalized:
\begin{equation}
    \vect{\Sigma} = \vect{W} \vect{\Lambda} \vect{W}^{T},
\end{equation}
in which $\vect{\Lambda}$ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues in decreasing order and $\vect{W}$ is a matrix with eigenvectors of $\vect{X}$ as rows.
These eigenvectors now span the desired space in which the data has maximal variance along the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue and decreasing variance along the other eigenvectors in the same order as the corresponding eigenvalues.
The dataset $\vect{X}$ can be mapped into the space spanned by the eigenvectors of its covariance matrix:
\begin{equation}
    \vect{T} = \vect{X} \vect{W}
\end{equation}
Removing dimensions from the end of the transformed dataset $\vect{T}$ reduces the dimensionality of the data but retains a maximum of the variances and therefore maximizes the information content in the data for the given number of remaining dimensions.

If for example two dimensional datapoints are distributed along a straight line, but subject to noise, PCA will approximate the dimension along which the data is correlated with the first principal component (Figure \ref{fig:PCA}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/GaussianScatterPCA.png}
    \caption{Principal components of gaussian data. Figure taken from Wikipedia.org \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GaussianScatterPCA.png}}
    \label{fig:PCA}
\end{figure}         



The GROMACS molecular dynamics package \cite{GROMACS4} contains an implementation of PCA that is particularly well suited to study the motions of proteins.
The analysis tool \texttt{g\_covar} computes the covariance matrix of the trajectory data.
Each time frame in the trajectory is treated as a datapoint.
The definition of the mean is chosen by the user and the frames of the trajectory are usually fit using least squares to a meaningful set of coordinates that describes the molecular conformation well (e.g. backbone or c-alpha atoms in the case of proteins).
The covariance matrix is then constructed using the same or a different set of coordinates, e.g. including side chain atoms as well.
The covariance matrix is diagonalized and the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are written to disk for use with the GROMACS tool \texttt{g\_anaeig}.
This tool is able to project each frame of the trajectory onto a given subset of principal component vectors, but keeping all spatial coordinates of the trajectory.
This results in a trajectory that displays the motion of the system along the chosen principal components and is very useful to study the most important conformational changes without the noise introduced by random thermal fluctuations and other smaller variations.

One drawback of this method for the study of proteins is its inability to detect non-linear motions that are of particular importance in protein folding \cite{SciMAP}.
This could be overcome by the usage of non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques and might offer interesting new insights in the dynamics of the peptide folding process.



If the system under study is well known or the problem at hand allows an \emph{a priori} definition of collective coordinates, the usage of principal component analysis can be circumvented.
For the determination of local energy minima of the CitAP--BSLA complex for example, most parts of the fusion protein was kept rigid and only the backbone dihedral angles of the linker domain were sampled by basin hopping.
The main quantities of interest were the orientation of the two globular protein parts to each other in the energy basins.
In order to arrive at a reduced set of coordinates that still distinguish the determined structures, the center of mass of the CitAP domain was shiftet to the origin of the coordiante system.
Next, the protein was rotatet to align a specified atom () with the positive x-axis.
The orientation of the BSLA domain of the fusion protein with respect to CitAP could now be described with three spherical coordinates: the radius between the two centers of mass, the polar angle and the azimuthal angle.
Finally, the orientation of BSLA with respect to the original coordinate system shiftet to the BSLA center of mass was defined again with the spherical polar and azimuthal angles.
This resulted in reduced set of only 3 coordinates, of which the distance of the two centers of mass appeared to be the least interesting, as the structured determined by basin hopping where all at similar distances.



% ==================================== %

\subsection{k-Means Clustering}

Apart from the dimensionality reduction approach to simplify complex data it is also possible to attempt to reduce the number of datapoints by carefully choosing a set of representative points.
If there is reason to assume that the datapoints at hand can be categorized in spatially seperated groups in feature space, algorithms exist to assign points close in space to the same cluster and keeping only one representative point per cluster.
Molecular dynamics simulations of proteins are especially suited for clustering, as the simulated systems will spend most of their time in energy basins and only ocassionaly crossing basin boundaries, therefore giving rise to well seperated clusters of points.
In the reported research, clustering was only used for find a small number of representative structures for those generated in the GMIN basin hopping calculations.
A variety of clustering algorithms exist, each with its specific strengths and weaknesses.
The algorithm in used in the data analysis of this research is the k-means clustering algorithm (citation).
It is especially suited for clustering proteins conformations, as the final number of clusters is determined automatically as part of the algorithm and the only parameter is a window width, as explained below, that affects the distance between points up to which they are recognized as belonging to the same cluster.

The k-means clustering algorithm moves each point in the direction in which the density increases fastest, therefore effectively moving it to the center of the cluster it belongs to.
To determine the density gradient at a point, the gradient of a sum of gaussians centered on all other points with width $h$ is computed (Formula *).
The window width $h$ determines the smoothness of the density function, where a large width corresponds to a very smooth energy function.

\section{Simulation Setups}

All citrate bound CitAP structures in the PDB contain a specific sodium ion attached to the first $\alpha$-helix as well as 3 water molecules in similar orientations in the vicinity of citrate.
This regularity makes it probable that these molecules might fulfill an active roll in CitAP's dynamics.
They have therefore been included in the simulation setups.
